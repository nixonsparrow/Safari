Safari Project
==============

The idea is to create automatically working environment of living animals that can interact with each other.

Examples of features:
- lion eats zebra if they meet (great chances);
- zebra eats plant if stepped onto (if hungry);
- animals drink water from lake;
- animals get old and die of age;
- animals can recreate;
- plants grow at random spots;
